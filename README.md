**Spotify Data Engineering End-to-End Project**

**Overview**
This project involves building an end-to-end data engineering pipeline on the AWS Cloud platform that processes and analyzes Spotify data. The project covers all key stages from data ingestion and transformation to querying and visualization.

**Project Architecture**

**Staging Layer**
• Data is initially stored in a staging layer on Amazon S3.

**ETL Pipeline (AWS Glue)**
• AWS Glue is used to build an ETL pipeline that extracts data from the staging layer, transforms it, and loads it into a data warehouse.

**Data Warehouse**
• Processed data is stored in a data warehouse on S3.
**AWS Glue Crawler**
• A Glue Crawler is used to create a database and populate tables in the data warehouse.
**Data Querying (AWS Athena)**
• AWS Athena is used to query data from the tables created by the Glue Crawler.

**Dataset Description**

**Source**
Spotify 2023 Dataset
**Files**
Albums: Contains details of albums, tracks, artists, and release dates.
Artists: Includes artist names, number of followers, and genres.
Spotify Data: Contains album ID, name, and popularity.
Spotify Features: Includes features like danceability, energy, loudness, mode, and more.
Tracks: Contains track ID, popularity, and explicitness.

**Project Steps**
1. **IAM User Setup**
   Objective: Set up an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user with appropriate permissions.
  Steps Covered:
  1) Creating an IAM user.
  2)Assigning necessary permissions for S3, Glue, Athena, and QuickSight.
  3)Logging in as the IAM user to verify access.
2. **S3 Bucket Setup**
   Objective: Set up S3 buckets to store and organize data.
   Steps Covered:
  1)Creating S3 buckets for the staging layer and data warehouse.
  2)Uploading preprocessed CSV files to the staging folder.
3. **AWS Glue ETL Pipeline**
  Objective: Create a data pipeline using AWS Glue to transfer and transform data.
  Steps Covered:
  1)Setting up the ETL pipeline using AWS Glue’s visual interface.
  2)Connecting and transforming datasets (albums, artists, tracks).
  3)Saving transformed data in the S3 data warehouse folder.
4. **Executing the AWS Glue Job**
  Objective: Execute the AWS Glue data pipeline and monitor its performance.
  Steps Covered:
  1)Creating an IAM role for Glue with S3 access.
  2)Configuring job resources (Glue version, worker type, etc.).
  3)Running the Glue job and verifying the output in S3.
5. **AWS Glue Crawler Setup**
   Objective: Set up an AWS Glue Crawler to create a data catalog.
   Steps Covered:
  1)Configuring and running a Glue Crawler to scan the S3 data warehouse.
  2)Creating a database and tables in Glue.
  3)Reviewing and editing the table schema.
6. **Querying Data with AWS Athena**
   Objective: Use AWS Athena to query data stored in S3.
   Steps Covered:
  1)Setting up AWS Athena and connecting it to the data catalog.
  2)Running SQL queries to fetch data from the data warehouse.
  3)Configuring S3 to store query results and viewing query results in Athena.
7. **Visualizing Data with AWS QuickSight**
   Objective: Use AWS QuickSight to create visualizations.
   Steps Covered:
  1)Setting up AWS QuickSight and connecting it to Athena.
  2)Creating data visualizations using the Spotify dataset.
  3)Publishing visualizations to share insights.

**Prerequisites**
AWS Account
Basic knowledge of AWS services (S3, Glue, Athena, QuickSight)
Familiarity with SQL and data visualization concepts

**Conclusion**
This project provides a comprehensive overview of building a data engineering pipeline on AWS, from data ingestion to visualization. It leverages key AWS services like S3, Glue, Athena, and QuickSight, making it a valuable learning experience for aspiring data engineers.
