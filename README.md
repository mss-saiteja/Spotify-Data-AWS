**Spotify Data Engineering End-to-End Project**

**Overview**
This project involves building an end-to-end data engineering pipeline on the AWS Cloud platform that processes and analyzes Spotify data. The project covers all key stages from data ingestion and transformation to querying and visualization.

**Project Architecture**

**Staging Layer**
• Data is initially stored in a staging layer on Amazon S3.

**ETL Pipeline (AWS Glue)**
• AWS Glue is used to build an ETL pipeline that extracts data from the staging layer, transforms it, and loads it into a data warehouse.

**Data Warehouse**
• Processed data is stored in a data warehouse on S3.
**AWS Glue Crawler**
• A Glue Crawler is used to create a database and populate tables in the data warehouse.
**Data Querying (AWS Athena)**
• AWS Athena is used to query data from the tables created by the Glue Crawler.

**Dataset Description**

**Source**
Spotify 2023 Dataset
**Files**
Albums: Contains details of albums, tracks, artists, and release dates.
Artists: Includes artist names, number of followers, and genres.
Spotify Data: Contains album ID, name, and popularity.
Spotify Features: Includes features like danceability, energy, loudness, mode, and more.
Tracks: Contains track ID, popularity, and explicitness.

**Project Steps**
1. **IAM User Setup**: Set up an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user with appropriate permissions.

2. **S3 Bucket Setup**: Set up S3 buckets to store and organize data.
   
3. **AWS Glue ETL Pipeline**: Create a data pipeline using AWS Glue to transfer and transform data.

4. **Executing the AWS Glue Job**: Execute the AWS Glue data pipeline and monitor its performance.
   
5. **AWS Glue Crawler Setup**: Set up an AWS Glue Crawler to create a data catalog.
   
6. **Querying Data with AWS Athena**: Use AWS Athena to query data stored in S3.
   
7. **Visualizing Data with AWS QuickSight**: Use AWS QuickSight to create visualizations.
 

**Prerequisites**
AWS Account
Basic knowledge of AWS services (S3, Glue, Athena, QuickSight)
Familiarity with SQL and data visualization concepts

**Conclusion**
This project provides a comprehensive overview of building a data engineering pipeline on AWS, from data ingestion to visualization. It leverages key AWS services like S3, Glue, Athena, and QuickSight, making it a valuable learning experience for aspiring data engineers.
